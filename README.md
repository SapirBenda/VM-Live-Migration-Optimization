As a part of my B.Sc. I'm glad to share a presentation I presented at the faculty, that talks about virtual machine live migration optimization.

âœ”Bandwidth Optimization: XBRLE algorithm to minimize the dirty data transferred in each iteration of the pre-copy live migration. As a result, the migration is faster and more efficient. 

âœ”Power Consumption Optimization: I compared two optimizations that help limit DC power consumption thus, make better use of the DC resources, reducing costs and environmental pollution: 
ðŸ”¹ Using hardware that supports DVFS (Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling) to control the power consumption of the data center.
ðŸ”¹Power capping enables limiting the CPU consumption of a server on demand, this affects the DC's power consumption.
